An Agentic LLM-powered Autonomous Research Framework

OpenDeepResearcher is an AI-driven research assistant designed to autonomously plan, search, analyze, and generate high-quality research reports. Using an agent-based architecture, the system mimics a human researcher by breaking down a topic, retrieving reliable information, and producing structured summaries.

This framework integrates local LLMs (LM Studio / Ollama), LangChain / LangGraph, and the Tavily Search API to build an efficient and fully automated research workflow.
